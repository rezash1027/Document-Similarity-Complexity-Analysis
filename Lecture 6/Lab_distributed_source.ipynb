    "# Lab: Understanding how to interface GitHub from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "With this exercise you will become familiar with Git and GitHub (https://github.com/), a very important resource to anyone doing data science. If you are already familiar with GitHub, this exercise may give you some new ideas of how can you interface GitHub and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab relates with the contents of last lecture in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will be executing various _Remote Procedure Calls_ (RPC) from your computer to the GitHub server, which will receive your requests, and send or store your data. For this, we will use GitHub's _API_, which is a type of RPC library that allows your computer to interface and make requests remotely to GitHub.\n",
    "2. Furthermore, data in GitHub is stored _robustly_, so one can generally trust that data in repositories in GitHub are safe. \n",
    "3. Lastly, the lab will guide you to interface with GitHub using _SSH encryption_, which guarantees authentication and privacy in the communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the lab aims to make you a bit more familiar with the various possible ways of using GitHub, which is always useful given how important GitHub is nowadays\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information of what GitHub is, please refer to this article: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-github/\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: _Do not use Google Colab_ to do this lab sheet as there are security implications by doing so. _Please use the lab computers or your own device._"

    "For running this lab you may need to install the following additional packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GitPython**: use to run _import git_ which allows python access to the git API (https://pypi.org/project/GitPython/)\n",
    "- **PyGithub**: used to run _import github_, which is needed to access the Github web API (https://pypi.org/project/PyGithub/)\n",
    "- **PrettyTable** (optional), used to display text results. (https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "(I believe most Python distributions come with the packages **requests**, **shutil**, and the others that are used)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to install these Python packages directly from within the Jupyter notebook, you can run the following code: \n",
